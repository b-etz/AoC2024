## AoC2024

**For this year's Advent of Code, I've decided to learn a Haskell.**

This is a collection of the brief code snippets required to process each daily file and return the results in the CLI.

For those with GHC installed, running each day's code should be as simple as typing...
```
$ ghc solve.hs
```
...and running either...
```
$ ./solve
```
or
```
$ ./solve.exe
```
...depending on your OS flavor.
